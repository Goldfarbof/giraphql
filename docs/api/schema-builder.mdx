# SchemaBuilder

SchemaBuilder is the core class of GiraphQl. It can be used to build types, and merge them into a
graphql.js Schema.

## `constructor<TypeInfo>(options)`

- typeParam: [`TypeInfo`]: A type that describes the backing models for your schema
- options: [`SchemaBuilderOptions`]

### `TypeInfo`

```typescript
type TypeInfo {
  // Shape of the context arg in your resolvers
  Context?: {};
  // A map of Object type names to their backing models.
  Objects?: {};
  // A map of Interface type names to their backing models.
  Interfaces?: {};
  // Map of scalar names to Input and Output shapes.  Can be used to overwrite default scalar types,
  // or to add type information for custom scalars
  Scalars?: {
    [s: string]: {
      Input: unknown;
      Output: unknown;
    };
  };
}
```

### SchemaBuilderOptions

```typescript
type SchemaBuilderOptions = {};
```

By default there are no options for SchemaBuilder, but plugins may contribute additional options/
