## Creating Object Types

This will walk you through creating your fist object types, some concepts in this guide will be
explained further in later guides.

1. Start by creating a backing model and adding it to your SchemaBuilder

The SchemaBuilder type signature will be explained further in the SchemaBuilder guide, for now the
impart part is to know the types provided here will be used to make sure resolvers return the
correct types, and to provide accurate types for the resolver arguments.

This should be the only place you need to manaully add types for your schema.

```typescript
interface Giraffe {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  height: number;
}

const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{
  Object: {
    Giraffe: Giraffe;
  };
  Context: {};
}>();
```

2. Create your object type

```typescript
const Giraffe = builder.createObjectType('Giraffe', {
  description: 'Long necks, cool patterns, taller than you.',
  shape: t => ({}),
});
```

3. Add some fields

```typescript
const Giraffe = builder.createObjectType('Giraffe', {
  description: 'Long necks, cool patterns, taller than you.',
  shape: t => ({
    name: t.exposeString('name'),
    age: t.int({
      resolve: parent => {
        // Do some date math to get an aproximate age from a birthday
        const today = new Date(new Date().toDateString());
        const birthday = new Date(parent.birthday.toDateString());
        const ageDifMs = Number(today) - Number(birthday);
        const ageDate = new Date(ageDifMs);

        return Math.abs(ageDate.getUTCFullYear() - 1970);
      },
    }),
    height: t.float({
      resolve: parent => parent.heightMeters,
    }),
  }),
});
```

4. Add a Query object as an entry point for fetching instances of the Giraffe type

```typescript
const Query = builder.createQueryType({
  shape: t => ({
    giraffe: t.field({
      type: Giraffe,
      resolve: () => ({ name: 'James', heightMeters: 5.2, birthday: new Date(2012, 11, 12) }),
    }),
  }),
});
```

5. Create a server

```typescript
// import apollo-server at top of file
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server';

// Build schema and start server with the types we wrote above
const schema = builder.toSchema([Query, Giraffe]);

const server = new ApolloServer({ schema });

server.listen(8000, (error: unknown) => {
  if (error) {
    throw error;
  }

  console.log('ðŸš€ Server started at http://127.0.0.1:8000');
});
```

6. Run your server (either with ts-node) by compiling your code and running it with node.
7. Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 to open the playground and query your API:

```graphql
query {
  giraffe {
    name
    age
    height
  }
}
```
