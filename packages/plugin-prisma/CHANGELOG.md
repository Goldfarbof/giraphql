## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- f04be64: #### Breaking

  - The Prisma plugin had been re-designed to use a prisma-generator to generate more efficient
    types. This requires new additional setup
  - Restored the original API that used model names as strings rather than passing in prisma
    delegates.

  #### New

  - Added support for `include` options on `prismaObject` and `prismaNode` types that are
    automatically loaded. This allows fields defined directly on those types to use nested relations
    without making additional requests.
  - Added `relationCount` method to prisma field builder and `totalCount` option to
    `relatedConnection` for more loading of counts.

  ### Fixed

  - Fixed some bugs related to field nullability
  - Improved include merging to further reduce the number of queries required to resolve a request

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- ea4d456: Add interoperability between prisma and errors plugins

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 5cdd001: Re-designed how types are propagated in the prisma plugin to improve performance. This
  requires a few breaking changes to how this plugin is used.

  This change was required because of performance issue in typescript which has been reported here:
  https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/45405

  If this is fixed, the API may be changed back to the slightly nicer string/name based version.

  You will need to remove PrismaClient from the builder types, so your builder setup now looks like:

  ```ts
  import PrismaPlugin, { PrismaTypes } from '@giraphql/plugin-prisma';

  export default new SchemaBuilder<{}>({
    prisma: {
      client: prisma,
    },
  });
  ```

  You will also need to replace model names with the prisma delegates from your prisma client like
  the following:

  ```ts
  builder.prismaObject(prisma.post, {
    findUnique: (post) => ({ id: post.id }),
    fields: (t) => ({
      id: t.exposeID('id'),
      title: t.exposeString('title'),
      author: t.relation('author'),
    }),
  });

  builder.queryType({
    fields: (t) => ({
      me: t.prismaField({
        type: prisma.user,
        resolve: async (query, root, args, ctx, info) =>
          prisma.user.findUnique({
            ...query,
            rejectOnNotFound: true,
            where: { id: ctx.userId },
          }),
      }),
    }),
  });
  ```

  See updated docs for more detailed usage.
