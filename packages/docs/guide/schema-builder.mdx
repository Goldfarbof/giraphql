The schema builder is the core of GiraphQL. It is used to create types, and then stich those types
into a GraphQL schema.

## Creating a Schema Builder

The SchemaBuilder takes a TypeParam that extends a Partial
[`TypeInfo`](http://localhost:3000/api-type-info).

These types are used as the backing models for the types defined by the SchemaBuilder.

```typescript
import SchemaBuilder from '@giraphql/core';

const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{
  // Type of the context object
  Context: {};
  // Backing models/shapes for Objects
  Object: {
    Droid: { primaryFunction: string };
  };
  // Backing models/shapes for Objects
  Interface: {
    Character: { name: string };
  };
  // Shapes for built-in or custom scalrs
  Scalar: {
    // Defines a shape for both input (field args) and outout (resolver return types)
    ID: { Input: string; Output: string | number };
  };
}>({
  // Optionally an array of plugins can be passed to the builder
  plugins: [],
});
```
