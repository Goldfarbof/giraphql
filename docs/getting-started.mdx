# GiraphQL SchemaBuilder

GiraphQL is library for creating GraphQL schemas in typescript using a strongly typed code first
approach. The GiraphQL schema builder makes writing schemas easy by providing a simple clean API
with helpful auto-completes, and removing the need for compile steps or defining the same types in
multiple files.

## Installing

```bash
yarn add @giraphql/core apollo-server
```

## Create a simple schema

```typescript
import SchemaBuilder from '@giraphql/core';

const builder = new SchemaBuilder();

const Query = builder.createQueryType({
  shape: t => ({
    hello: t.string({
      args: {
        name: t.arg.string(),
      },
      resolve: (parent, { name }) => `hello, ${name || 'World'}`,
    }),
  }),
});

const schema = builder.toSchema([Query]);
```

## Create a server

The schema generated by GiraphQL is a standard graphql.js schema and can be used with several
graphql server implimentations including apollo server.

```typescript
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server';

const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
});

server.listen(3000);
```
